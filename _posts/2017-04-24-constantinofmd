Introduction: Prenatal exposure to excess glucocorticoids increases risk
for psychiatric disease. We have demonstrated that antenatal synthetic
glucocorticoids (sGC) program gene transcription in the hypothalamic
paraventricular nucleus (PVN), with strongest effects in females.
Understanding the relationship between gene expression and phenotype
allows for predictive modelling, which has broad implications for the
use of gene profiles in disease detection. Here, we hypothesized that
transcriptional programming of the PVN is correlated to behavioral
outcomes and can be used in predictive modelling.

Methods: Pregnant guinea pigs received 3 courses of betamethasone
(Beta;1mg/kg) or saline (C) in late gestation. Total locomotor activity
in open-field (OFA) was measured in female offspring on postnatal day 24
and brains collected at day 40. PVN was micro-punched (C;n=5,
Beta;n=5);RNA extracted for RNA-seq; data analyzed using standard
bioinformatics. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out on
normalized expression profiles of significantly up-regulated genes, and
OFA scores. Relationships were analyzed by circle of correlation and
linear regression. Multiple regression combined gene profiles to predict
OFA, linear regression determined the coefficient of determination of
predicted and observed OFA.

Results: PCA showed OFA is associated with expression of Greb1l
(estrogen receptor signaling), Prlr (prolactin receptor) & Trim66
(transcriptional regulator). Linear regression revealed the correlation
to be significant (Greb1l: R2=0.71, p=0.002, Prlr: R2=0.51, p=0.019,
Trim66: R2=0.58, p=0.01), and significant correlation between predicted
and observed OFA (R2=0.80, p=0.015).

Conclusions: This is the first evidence of a correlation between
stress-activated locomotor behavior and gene expression in the PVN
following prenatal sGC. These findings provide insight into the
potential mechanisms of antenatal sGC and how these molecular events
relate to behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrated that predictive
modelling using gene expression accurately predicts stress-activated
locomotor behavior, providing proof of principal for the use of gene
expression modelling in disease prediction, detection, and prevention.
