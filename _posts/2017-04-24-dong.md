Learning and memory formation are critical physiological functions.
There is increasing evidence that spontaneously active neurons possess
distinct rules of activity-dependent plasticity as compared to quiescent
neurons. In this study, we used a well-defined aversive learning model
of aerial respiration in the mollusk *Lymnaea stagnalis* to study the
role of spontaneously firing activity of the respiratory pacemaker
neuron Right Pedal Dorsal 1 (RPeD1) in aversive long-term memory (LTM)
formation. We provide the first evidence suggesting that lower neuronal
activity at the time of learning may be correlated with better memory
formation in spontaneously active neurons. We also identified early
functional predictors of aversive LTM formation that allowed us to
characterize memory-specific and time-dependent changes in RPeD1
spontaneous firing activity during the memory consolidation process.
Taken together, our findings provide new insights into the diversity of
cellular mechanisms underlying memory formation.
