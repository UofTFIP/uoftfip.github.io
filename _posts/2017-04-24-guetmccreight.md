The inputs to any given cell type will dictate its *in vivo* roles, such
as inputs that occur during behavior-associated network rhythms. It is
therefore important to characterize the types of inputs that different
cell types receive. Here we focus on computationally predicting the
properties of inputs along the dendrites of interneuron specific-3 (IS3)
cells in CA1 hippocampus. Using experimentally-obtained excitatory and
inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs), we optimize the
synaptic parameter values for each compartment in a passive
morphologically detailed IS3 cell multi-compartment model, such that the
model successfully replicates the data. We obtain conductance values for
single AMPA and GABA~A~ receptors from the literature, which, together
with our optimized synaptic weight values, could allow estimating ranges
of AMPA and GABA~A~ receptors per synapse with distance from soma. Our
simulations showed that the estimates of receptor number per synapse are
larger than could be expected, given the maximal numbers of receptors
per synapse found in other cell types. To rectify this over-estimate, we
established a simplified linear synaptic weight rule with distance from
soma based on the weight values obtained from the most optimal fits.
With the results obtained, we predict higher estimates of synaptic
receptor densities in IS3 cell distal dendrites. Moving forward, these
estimates of weight values along IS3 cell dendrites will contribute
towards simulating *in vivo*-like activity patterns with our IS3 cell
model.
