Spinal cord lamina I neurons function as a hub of nociception, and
exhibit hyperexcitability in chronic pain models. Voltage-gated calcium
channels (VGCCs) have been implicated in chronic pain, however their
functionality in lamina I neurons is poorly understood. Here, we
measured activity-driven calcium responses in lamina I neurons using
simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology. We made
current-clamp recordings from lamina I neurons in spinal cord slices,
loading the calcium indicator OGB-1 and control fluorophore AF-594 via
the patch pipette. Neuronal calcium levels before, during, and after
action potential (AP) generation were quantified as ∆G/R (change in
OGB-1 intensity as compared to AF-594). Recordings were made from over
150 lamina I neurons. In 98% of neurons a single AP was sufficient to
increase ΔG/R in the somatic cytosol (ΔG/R=0.11, n=157 cells), nucleus
(ΔG/R=0.049, n=157 cells), dendrites (ΔG/R=0.16, n=157 cells), and
dendritic spines (ΔG/R=0.089, n=19 spines). These calcium responses were
ablated by the VGCC blocker cadmium. Responses didn't degrade along
dendrites from 20µm (ΔG/R=0.10, n=6 dendrites) to 160µm (ΔG/R=0.13, n=6
dendrites) away from the soma, indicating dependence on VGCCs and active
backpropagation. We found no differences when grouping calcium responses
by cellular morphology or firing-type. Our findings suggest that all
lamina I neurons produce AP-induced calcium responses that backpropagate
actively into their dendritic arbour, which has been shown in other
neuronal cell types to increase cellular excitability.
