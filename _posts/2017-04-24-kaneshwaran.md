General anesthetics trigger memory deficits that persist long after the
drugs have been eliminated by causing a persistent increase in an
extrasynaptic GABA~A~ receptor (GABA~A~R)-mediated tonic inhibitory
current in neurons in the hippocampus (_J Clin Invest_, 2014). These
postanesthetic memory deficits may contribute to postoperative delirium
and cognitive deficits (_N Engl J Med_, 2015). The sedative agent
dexmedetomidine (DEX) attenuates postoperative delirium in ICU patients;
however, the underlying mechanism(s) are unclear (_Lancet_, 2016; _Br
Med J_, 2014). Previous data from our lab show that DEX reverses the
persistent tonic GABA current increase induced by the anesthetic
etomidate (ETOM). The aim of this study was to identify the signalling
pathway through which DEX reverses the increase in tonic current.
Primary cultures of astrocytes and neurons were acutely treated with
drugs under various conditions and whole-cell voltage clamp techniques
were used to record neuronal tonic GABA current 24 h later. Western blot
and qPCR assays were performed to analyze protein and mRNA levels in
astrocytes treated with DEX. Conditioned medium from DEX (100
nM)-treated astrocytes reverses ETOM-induced persistent increase in
tonic current. DEX fails to reverse the tonic current increase when
applied directly to neurons. An ERK inhibitor, PD98059 (50 μM), applied
to astrocytes, and a BDNF receptor (TrkB) antagonist, ANA12 (10 ng/mL),
applied to neurons, abolish astrocyte-mediated DEX effect on tonic
current; while BDNF (200 pg/mL), applied to neurons, mimics DEX effect.
DEX increases ERK phosphorylation and BDNF mRNA levels in astrocytes.
Collectively, our results suggest that DEX causes ERK phosphorylation in
astrocytes and stimulates astrocytic BDNF release that acts on neuronal
TrkB receptors, to reverse the anesthetic-induced increase in neuronal
tonic current that underlies postanesthetic memory deficits. Our studies
identify elements of the DEX signaling pathway that can be targeted as
part of treatment strategies for postanesthetic memory deficits.
