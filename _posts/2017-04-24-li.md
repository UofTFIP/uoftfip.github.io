Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury leads to hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy, which is a major cause of acute mortality and chronic
neurological morbidity in neonates. In this study, we investigated the
effects of swelling-induced chloride current ICl,swell in
hypoxic-ischemic brain injury using
4-(2-Butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentylindan-1-on-5-yl) oxybutyric acid
(DCPIB), a selective blocker of swelling-induced chloride current
ICl,swell. DCPIB was injected intraperitoneally to postnatal
seven-day-old (P7) CD1 mouse pups of either sex and a modified
hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury model was performed. The outcomes
were evaluated using 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC)
staining, cresyl violet (Nissl) staining and whole brain imaging.
Neurobehavioral tests were also used to assess the sensorimotor and
vestibular recovery outcomes of the HI. DCPIB attenuates the infarction
volume of HI injury in vivo, and improves neurobehavioral performance
after HI. Our results indicate that DCPIB has neuroprotective effect on
neonatal HI brain injury.
