Neuropathic pain is characterized by pain resulting from damage or
dysfunction of the nervous system. Microglia in the spinal cord have
been implicated as a critical mediator of mechanical hypersensitivity
associated with traumatic nerve injury. After injury, microglia
signalling produces downregulation of the potassium chloride
cotransporter KCC2, resulting in disinhibition of spinal neurons and
development of hypersensitivity. However, we recently showed that
microglia do not contribute to pain hypersensitivity in female mice. It
remains to be determined whether KCC2 downregulation is involved in pain
processing in females despite a sex difference in microglial
involvement. Thus, we interrogated the role of KCC2 in neuropathic pain
in both sexes. Neuropathic pain was induced in rodents using spared
nerve injury or spinal nerve ligation. Investigation of
chloride-mediated disinhibition in the spinal cord was conducted using
in-vivo electrophysiology. KCC2 expression was interrogated using
immunohistochemical techniques. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed with
von Frey fibers. Drugs were applied via intrathecal injections. First,
we found that KCC2 blockade produces disinhibition in both sexes.
Second, we demonstrated that nerve injury results in chloride
dysregulation in males and females. Third, we determined that there was
no sex difference in KCC2 downregulation after nerve injury in the
dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Finally, we found that neuropathic pain
hypersensitivity is dependent on KCC2 in both sexes. Our experiments
indicate that KCC2 downregulation is critical in female pain processing,
which suggests that KCC2 may be a viable therapeutic target for
neuropathic pain in both sexes.
