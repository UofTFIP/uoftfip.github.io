Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a major sequelae of
traumatic brain injury (TBI) in youth. Our objective was to examine
whether genetic risk for ADHD and altered brain structure differentially
predict ADHD symptoms in youth with and without a history of TBI.
Medical history, ADHD symptoms, genetics and multimodal neuroimaging
were assessed in a large sample of children and youth. The number of
ADHD symptoms endorsed was compared between those with and without a
history of TBI (TBI=666, NoTBI=5590). Whether a history of TBI interacts
with genetics or brain to predict ADHD symptoms in children and youth
was examined by assessing 1) ADHD polygene score (PGS) (TBI=320,
NoTBI=2135), 2) basal ganglia volumes (TBI=112, NoTBI=719), and 3)
corpus callosum and corona radiata fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean
diffusivity (MD) (TBI=87, NoTBI=514). Youth with a history of TBI
endorsed more ADHD symptoms than those without a history of TBI. PGS was
less strongly associated with ADHD in participants with a history of TBI
than in youth without a history of TBI. Youth with and without a history
of TBI showed differential relationships between brain volume, FA, and
MD, and ADHD symptoms in the globus pallidus, the genu of the corpus
callosum and superior corona radiate respectively. In the striatum,
posterior corona radiata and sensory projections of the corpus callosum
associations between volume, MD, and FA respectively, and ADHD symptoms
were not moderated by history of TBI. The identification of distinct
ADHD etiology in youth with a history of TBI contributes to the
dissection of clinical heterogeneity in the disorder. Results indicate
that genetic predisposition to ADHD does not increase the risk for ADHD
associated with TBI. ADHD associated with TBI may be a result of
mechanical insult to similar and distinct neural pathways than those
affected in developmental ADHD.
