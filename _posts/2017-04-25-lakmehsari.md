 The mammalian nucleus has invaginations from the cytoplasm, termed
nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR). With increased resolution of cellular
imaging, progress has been made in understanding the formation and
function of NR. In fact, nucleoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis has been
implicated in the regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, and cell
death. However, the majority of studies focus on cross-sectional or
single plane analyses of NR invaginations, providing an incomplete
assessment of its distribution and content. Here, we provided advanced
imaging and three-dimensional reconstructive analyses characterizing the
molecular constituents of nuclear invaginations in the nucleoplasm in
HEK-293 cells, murine C2C12 muscle cells, and cardiac myocytes. We
demonstrated the presence of critical Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory channels
including SERCA2a, and STIM1 in the nucleoplasm in cultured primary
mouse cardiomyocytes. We have shown for the first time the presence of
STIM1 in the nucleoplasm, suggesting the presence of store-operated
calcium entry (SOCE) mechanism in nucleoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation. These
results show that nucleoplasmic invaginations contain continuous ER
components, mitochondria, and intact nuclear membranes, highlighting the
extremely detailed and complex nature of this organellar structure.
