Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an intestinal incretin hormone
released by the L cell in response to nutrient intake whose main action
is to enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Over evolution,
organisms have developed circadian rhythms in order to adjust their
metabolic function to pre-defined changes in the environment such as the
feeding-fasting cycles. We have recently identified a circadian pattern
of GLP-1 secretion that parallels rhythmic expression of the core clock
gene Bmal1 in the mGLUTag L cell line. Furthermore, we have previously
shown that pre-treatment of mGLUTag L cells with the saturated fatty
acid palmitate results in the dampening of Bmal1 gene expression. We
thus hypothesized that suppressing Bmal1 gene expression with palmitate
will result in impaired circadian secretion of GLP-1. The peak and
trough of Bmal1 expression in mGLUTag cells occurred at 8 and 20 hr
after synchronization, respectively, and GLP-1 secretion was increased
at 8 hr as compared to 20 hr (p&lt;0.01). Pre-treatment with the
saturated fatty acid palmitate, a major component of a high-fat/high
sucrose Western diet, dampened Bmal1 expression (p&lt;0.01) at 8 hr
after synchronization, in association with suppressed levels of ATP
(p&lt;0.05), NAD<sup>+</sup> (p&lt;0.01), and GIP-induced GLP-1 secretion
(p&lt;0.001). In contrast, palmitate had no effect on either Bmal1
expression or GLP-1 secretion at 20 hr, suggesting that Bmal1 positively
regulates circadian secretion of GLP-1. Collectively, these data suggest
that chronic exposure to the saturated fatty acid palmitate disrupts the
L cell clock resulting in impaired GLP-1 secretion. Understanding the
normal rhythm of GLP-1 secretion, and how it can be affected by time and
diet, is crucial to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for
the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
