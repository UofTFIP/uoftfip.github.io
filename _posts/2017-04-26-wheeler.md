The endocrine hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) facilitates
metabolic homeostasis through the enhancement of glucose-dependent
insulin secretion. Exocytosis of GLP-1 by the intestinal L-cell
following nutrient ingestion is essential for the actions of degradation
inhibitors that are now widely used to treat patients with type 2
diabetes (T2D). To develop novel approaches for the treatment of T2D,
the capacity to enhance endogenous GLP-1 secretion from the L-cell is
currently being explored. We previously used intestinal
epithelial-specific inducible syntaxin1a knockout (IE-syn1a KO) mice to
show that loss of syn1a in the mouse intestinal epithelium reduces oral
glucose-stimulated GLP-1 secretion in association with deficient
glucose-stimulated insulin release and glucose intolerance. We therefore
hypothesized that loss of syn1a impairs L-cell exocytosis. Secretion
assays performed on adult mouse ileal cell (AMIC) cultures generated
from IE-syn1a KO mice demonstrated no difference in basal GLP-1
secretion as compared to control animals. However, cultures from
IE-syn1a KO mice displayed a reduction in forskolin-stimulated GLP-1
secretion, to 37% of the response found in controls (p&lt;0.001). We
thus crossed IE-syn1a KO mice with proglucagon-Venus (L-cell reporter)
mice to permit identification of the L-cell for exocytotic analysis. As
exocytosis by the primary intestinal L-cell has not previously been
described, we utilized 2-photon microscopy to visualize secretory
granule (SG) fusion events in control L-cells, and revealed that
stimulated exocytosis of GLP-1 is biphasic. However, L-cells from
intestinal-epithelial syn1a-deficient mice demonstrated a dramatic
reduction in SG fusion events, such that 1st phase exocytosis was
reduced to basal levels (p&lt;0.05) and 2nd phase was abolished
(p&lt;0.05).Our findings identify a novel mechanism regulating L-cell
exocytosis, establishing syn1a as a positive regulator of stimulated
GLP-1 secretion and, hence, insulin release following a meal.Thus, these
studies hold important implications for development of GLP-1
secretagogues to treat patients with T2D or obesity.
