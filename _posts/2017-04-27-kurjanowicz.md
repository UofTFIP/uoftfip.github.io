Assessment of sperm telomere length (spTL) in infertile men presents a
number of challenges: few cells from oligozoospermic patients, high
sperm-to-sperm heterogeneity, varying levels of sperm DNA damage, and
distinguishing between chromosomal (Chr) and extrachromosomal (EC)
telomeric sequences. We have previously demonstrated that DNA extraction
methods can include EC telomeric sequences that bias downstream
measurements towards shorter telomeres. Here, we show that the haloFISH
assay overcomes these challenges. Sperm were isolated via two-layer
density gradient centrifugation (CRYOS Sperm Filter, Fertitech). HeLa
and GM847 cells served as EC(-) and EC(+) controls. HaloFISH was
performed according to Komosa et al. (2015) with incorporation of
dithiothreitol (DTT, 80mM) and proteinase K (250ug/ml) during cell lysis
for sperm. Nuclei were selected at random and imaged in z-stacks at 0.1
μm intervals on a wide-field microscope (Zeiss Axioplan 2) at 40x/0.95
Corr ∞/0.13–0.21 objective for Controls and 63x/1.40 Corr ∞/0.17
oil-immersion objective for sperm. Images underwent iterative
deconvolution and quantitation using Volocity (PerkinElmer v6.3). The
presence of EC telomeric DNA in HeLa (n=20) and GM847 cells (n=20) was
confirmed, with less EC telomere foci present in HeLa compared to GM847
(p&lt;0.001). We then distinguished, for the first time, Chr and EC
telomeric DNA populations in individual sperm cells (n=30). The number
of EC telomere foci in sperm was comparable to that of GM847 cells,
which are known to contain high levels of EC DNA and are positive for
alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). HeLa cells had less EC
telomere foci compared to sperm and GM847 (p&lt;0.01). The number of EC
telomere foci varied between sperm cells, demonstrating sperm-to-sperm
that was well captured by haloFISH. Overall, this method will allow for
analysis of spermatozoa from oligozoospermic patients and highly
selected, biologically relevant sperm populations. It distinguishes
between Chr and EC telomere populations, which will be used to study
patient-specific telomere distributions and their relationship with male
fertility in the future.
