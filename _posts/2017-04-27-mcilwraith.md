Phoenixin (PNX) is a novel reproductive peptide implicated in control of
the reproductive axis through regulation of gonadotropin-releasing
hormone and kisspeptin in the hypothalamus, and leutinizing hormone in
the pituitary. This amidated 20-amino acid peptide is cleaved from small
integral membrane protein 20 (SMIM20) and is most highly expressed in
the hypothalamus. The PNX receptor, GPR173, is expressed in the brain,
pituitary, and gonads, which further suggests involvement of PNX in
reproduction. However, it is currently unknown how PNX is regulated at
the gene level. We investigated whether 17β-estradiol, necessary for HPG
feedback control;bisphenol A (BPA), a putative estrogen mimic reported
to disrupt reproductive function; and/orpalmitate, a dietary saturated
fatty acid, affect SMIM20 expression. Using RT-PCR, we observed that 100
nM 17β-estradiol had no effect on _SMIM20_ expression over 24 hours in
hypothalamic cell lines from female mice (mHypoE-41 and mHypoA-59). In
contrast, 100 uM BPA induced _SMIM20_ expression from 2 to 24 hours in
these cell lines, with a 1.5 fold increase at 16 and 24 hours in the
mHypoE-41 cells. These differential results indicate that BPA may be
acting through a pathway independent of estrogen. Additionally, we found
that in male-derived cells(mHypoE-46 and mHypoA-2/12), 50 uMpalmitate
increased expression of _SMIM20_ by 1.5 fold at 16 and 24 hours.
Interestingly, treatment with BPA increased _GPR173_ expression at 2 and
4 hours in the mHypoE-41 and mHypoA-59 cells, respectively, then
attenuated expression at 16 and 24 hours in both lines. Similarly,
palmitate significantly repressed _GPR173_ expression by 20% at 16 hours
and by 15% at 24 hours in mHypoE-46 cells. We continue to investigate
the mechanisms through which BPA and palmitate
affect _SMIM20_ expression, and thus PNX expression. Uncovering factors
that regulate the PNX gene will lead to a better understanding of
hypothalamic reproductive control.
