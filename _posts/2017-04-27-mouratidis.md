Pregnant women at risk for preterm delivery (approximately 10% of
pregnancies) are treated with synthetic glucocorticoids (sGC) to mature
the fetal lungs and reduce infant mortality. Single course treatment
with sGC has been linked with increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis response to stress in children and young second generation
sheep offspring (F2). This study sought to investigate the effects of
prenatal sGC on the cortisol response to stress and expression of HPA
regulatory genes in the anterior pituitary of F1 and F2 adult male and
female guinea pigs. Pregnant guinea pigs (F0) were treated with a single
course of the sGC betamethasone (Beta; 1mg/kg) or saline (Veh;
0.166ml/kg) on gestational days 50 and 51. F1 female offspring were
mated with control males to produce F2 offspring. Salivary cortisol
response to open field stress was measured in adult F1 and F2 animals.
Avpr1b, Crhr1, Pomc, Nr3c1 (Gr), and Nr3c2 (Mr) mRNA were analyzed in
the anterior pituitary by qRT-PCR. sGC exposure led to a reduced
cortisol stress response in F1 males and an increased response in F2
males. The HPA response to stress was unaffected by sGC in F1 females,
whereas F2 females demonstrated a decreased the cortisol response at
60min. F1 males exhibited a decreased expression of Mr following sGC
exposure, whereas F­1 females were unaffected. In the F2 generation, sGC
led to a reduced expression of Avpr1b in males, as well as an increase
in Gr expression and a decrease in Pomc expression in females. This is
the first study to demonstrate that single course prenatal treatment
with sGC programs HPA function in adult F2 offspring. This is clinically
important since alterations in HPA function can result in adverse
cardiometabolic and neurobehavioural health outcomes. Supported by CIHR
