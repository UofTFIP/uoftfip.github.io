Objectives: Infiltration of leukocytes into the uterine tissues during labour is an essential step in parturition. In this study we examined the differences between labouring and non-labouring term decidual conditioned media with respect to (1) cytokine/chemokine profiles, (2) maternal peripheral leukocyte activation, (3) endothelial activation and (4) maternal peripheral leukocyte migration.

Methods: Decidua samples were collected from the fetal membranes of placentae obtained from elective caesarean section of term not in labour (TNL) or term labour (TL) deliveries. All women provided an  informed consent. Tissue underwent collagenase digestion to obtain primary cells. To generate decidual conditioned media (DCM), cells were cultured in serum-free media for 48 hours. Simultaneous detection of multiple cytokines was achieved using the 45-plex human chemokine Luminex assay. To determine leukocyte activation, peripheral maternal blood was collected from pregnant women, treated with TNL and TL DCM and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies targeting leukocyte subpopulations and activation markers CD11b, CD44, and CD55 followed by flow cytometric analysis. Endothelial cell activation was determined by flow cytometry analysis after treatment with TNL DCM and TL DCM using fluorophore-conjugated antibodies specific for cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) ICAM1, VCAM1, PECAM1 and E-selectin. A transendothelial migration assay of primary neutrophils isolated from pregnant women was performed to test the chemoattractant ability of TNL and TL DCM. A migration assay was used to test the chemoattractant ability of the TNL and TL DCM on primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

Results: 4 cytokines (G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, IFNg) were significantly upregulated in TL DCM compared to TNL DCM. Activation marker CD11b shows a trend of increase on monocytes and granulocytes after stimulation with TL DCM compared to TNL DCM. Cell adhesion molecules ICAM1 and VCAM1 show a trend of increased expression on endothelial cells after stimulation with TL DCM compared to TNL DCM. An increase in the number of migrated maternal blood peripheral leukocytes (neutrophils and PBMCs) is found in response to TL DCM compared to TNL DCM. 

Conclusion: Four major cytokines were significantly upregulated in media conditioned by labouring decidual cells compared to non-labouring and induced endothelial-leukocyte activation and leukocyte migration, implicating their role in the inflammatory pathway responsible for the infiltration of maternal leukocytes into the uterine tissues during labour.  Future experiments will aim to determine the specific role that these upregulated cytokines play.
