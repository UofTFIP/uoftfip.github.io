First-year courses introduce a broad discipline, but frequently omit descriptions about research evidence and how it was acquired. Our aim was to expose first-year students to current research and to develop their research skills. To achieve this, a course (Biomedical Research at the Cutting Edge, PSL190H) was established, modeled on one previously described with modifications (1), in which two scientists each delivered a high-level research seminar. Each seminar was followed by classes and assignments to explain the seminar and develop skills. Assignments included questions asking students to: draw a model based on evidence, interpret results, create figures, design experiments, and orally present research findings. To examine course effectiveness, an online survey (Classroom Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE)) (2) and a short-answer test were administered at the beginning and end of the course. CURE asks students about their attitudes to science and to estimate their learning, while the short-answer test assessed actual research skills. In the CURE survey, students reported learning gains in several areas including: “the ability to read and understand primary literature” and “skill in interpretation of results”. Indeed, when pre- vs post-test scores were analysed, students demonstrated statistically significant improvements in questions related to the analysis and interpretation of experimental data. In course evaluations, all stated that the course “deepened understanding of the subject matter”. In addition, two thirds of the students applied to take a second-year independent research course. Our approach can be adapted by instructors in any discipline who are interested preparing students for independent research.
