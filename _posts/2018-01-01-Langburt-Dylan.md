Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the most prominent type of cardiovascular disease and a leading cause of death worldwide. Although reperfusion therapy has the potential to improve outcomes for IHD patients, it can also produce detrimental effects, collectively referred to as ischemia-reperfusion injury (IR injury). Recently, it was demonstrated that the outcome from induced IR injury in mice was associated with two highly expressed heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunits, Gi2 and Gi3. Specifically, knockout of Gi2 worsened cardiac outcomes, whereas knockout of Gi3 improved the response to IR injury. Preliminary data from our lab points to the divergent roles of Gi2 and Gi3 in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis (autophagy) and the selective targeting of mitochondrial degradation (mitophagy).  Additionally, we propose that the activity state of Gi3 (GDP-bound; inactive form or GTP-bound; active form) mediates an important switch between the mitophagic and autophagic signaling machinery (Vps34/Vps15/Atg14-containing complexes). My project is focused on elucidating Gi3’s role in IR injury, and assessing the mechanisms of the improved outcomes in the Gi3 KO mice. Complete functional (electrocardiogram, ultrasound, and PV-loop) and histologic (TTC/Evan’s Blue staining, immunohistochemistry) analyses will be performed at various time points after induced IR injury to determine the nature and timeline of the reperfusion injury in WT and Gi3 KO mice. IR-injury protocols will be repeated using inhibitors (3-methlyadenine) and activators (rapamycin) of autophagy to examine the extent to which altered autophagic activity may be driving the differences in IR injury outcomes. In parallel to the work described above, I am generating Gi3 KO human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) using Crisper/Cas9 targeting constructs. Together with WT and Gi3 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), I will have a complete set of cell-based genetic tools to study the role of Gi3 in cell metabolism, autophagy, and mitophagy in cultured cells. Successful Crisper/Cas9 KO of Gai3 in HEKs have been demonstrated through restriction enzyme digestion of genomic PCR samples, immunoblotting, and are currently being validated using sequencing. Developing a better understanding of Gai3’s role in regulating cardiac health during reperfusion therapy is a potential step toward designing therapeutic strategies that limit its damaging effects.
