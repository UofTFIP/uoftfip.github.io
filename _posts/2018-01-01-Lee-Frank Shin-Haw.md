Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) remains the leading cause of hospitalization and mortality characterized by impaired ventricular function and reduced cardiac output. Although the etiology of CHF varies, investigations into cardiac diseases have shown that the sarcoplasmic reticulum SR plays an important role in the development and progression of many heart diseases, responsible for biochemical changes, structural remodeling, and deterioration of the muscle. The SR provides many critical functions in cells. However, many aspects of its structural organization remain largely unknown, particularly in cells with a highly differentiated SR. Here, we report cardiac enriched, SR membrane protein, REEP5 that is centrally involved in regulating SR morphology and stress responses in cardiac myocytes. Advanced three-dimensional confocal imaging showed REEP5 localization to the SR and the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (j-SR) in differentiated myocytes. Targeted lentiviral-mediated depletion of REEP5 in primary cardiac myocytes led to SR membrane vacuolization and a marked decrease in myocyte contractility along with disrupted Ca2+ cycling shown by transmission electron microscopy and optical mapping functional imaging. Furthermore, REEP5 depletion contributed to the SR stress response observed during cardiac disease progression. Consequently, In vivo morpholino-mediated REEP5 reduction in zebrafish embryos was associated with reduced heart rates, defective cardiac looping and cardiac dysfunction. These findings provide significant insight into SR biology and physiology and reveal the previously unknown, and indispensable role of REEP5 in SR organization and function in the heart.
