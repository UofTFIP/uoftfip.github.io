Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in the mouse aorta significantly contribute to cardiovascular health and disease and are derived from distinct embryological lineages. Aortic Sca-1+ vascular smooth muscle progenitor cells give rise to VSMC; however, the developmental origins of these progenitors, and the specific role of the VSMC derived from them, are unknown. Lineage tracing of Myf5-expressing embryological tissues (i.e. somitic mesoderm) following tamoxifen-induced recombination at E8.5 reveals that 45Â±6% of aortic Sca-1+ cells in adult mice arise from the somitic mesoderm. These somite-derived Sca-1+ cells expand between 4-6 weeks after birth and become a major contributor to the adult mouse aorta. This expansion occurs independent of bone marrow, spleen, blood, or circulating cells. What requires further investigation are the role of these Sca-1+ VSMC progenitors in diseases such as hypertension or aortic aneurysm, and the significance of post-natal aortic Sca-1+ cell expansion. We note somite-derived Sca-1+ VSMC progenitors as a distinct population of Sca-1+ progenitors, but whether differences exist between somite-derived Sca-1+ VSMC progenitors and other VSMC progenitors remains unexplored. We posit that a better understanding of the contributions of VSMC progenitors may reveal their roles in vascular diseases which may rationalize their therapeutic targeting.
